    <p>In the 1980s and the early 1990s, The Cocteau Twins were at the height of their popularity, mesmerizing audiences with their ethereal and dreamy soundscapes. Their personal lives and the music they produced frequently reflected each other's romanticism and longing. Many of the band's love songs were inspired by Elizabeth Fraser's long-term relationship with Robin Guthrie, the other band member. 

    Their drug use, which they frequently employed as a creative tool to access their subconscious and improve their artistic expression, had an impact on their music as well. Fraser has talked in particular about her use of LSD and how it enabled her to enter a different state of consciousness and produce some of her most iconic lyrics.</p>
